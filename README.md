What Is A CodeChef College Chapter?
CodeChef College Chapters are the programming clubs run and maintained by the official Chapter Leaders and mentored by CodeChef. They aim to make learning competitive programming accessible for students across the globe.

The mission of CodeChef College Chapters is to build a robust Competitive Programming culture in educational institutions. College Chapters help students become better problem solvers by fostering learning and professional development. We believe every student should be given the proper mentorship and resources to become a better programmer and compete on a global scale.

Chapter Leaders are responsible for conducting different activities and engagements to achieve this mission, such as:

Creating, recruiting, growing, and leading the College Chapter
Setting a vision for the College Chapter and creating goals aligned with it
Organizing regular events, meetups, and speaker sessions
Monitoring the growth of students on campus and ensuring a peer-learning environment
Working with CodeChef team for improvements and development of the College Chapter

What Our Chapters Do
For us, it's about building a robust Competitive Programming culture and making it accessible to all. Let's take a look at what our Chapters do to make this come alive.

Here is a glimpse of the impact we made on the coding culture of the colleges in our 2020-21 Cohort!


Previous Cohort Highlights
The CodeChef College Chapters is a close-knit community where everyone shares highlights and best practices from their events. This pushes everyone to give their best and create a culture of learning.

Our previous cohort, which ran from November 2020 to July 2021, was really active and truly showcased their passion for spreading knowledge about Competitive Programming in their chapters. These are some of the statistics from the cohort:

280+ College Chapters
340+ Contests
145+ Seminars
140+ Speaker Sessions
165+ Workshops
Organize Events
Throughout the year, our College Chapters have been exposed to the programming landscape's realities. CodeChef mentors Chapter Leaders so they understand the problem's enormity better. This helps them gain the necessary skills such as vision setting, planning, execution, etc to tackle this problem.

Our Chapters bring in some amazing energy on their campus through events like programming contests hosted on CodeChef, workshops, guest lectures, or fest collaborations that promote programming and inspire the students.

Few activities that they do:

Daily Problem Solving and Discussion
DSA Learning Sessions/ Workshops
Upsolving Sessions for Monthly Contests
ICPC Preparation
Closed Programming Contests

Outreach And Awareness

The success of an event is judged by the number of people who participate and enjoy taking part in it. The Chapter Leaders ensure a strong pre buzz and post buzz both online and offline to create max awareness. They also capture moments of the event to be put on social media.

Here are the five CodeChef College Chapters who have done tremendous work in spreading awareness about Competitive Programming
